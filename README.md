Messages written in the SLOPI (pronounced "sloppy") communication style are:

- Searchable: Messages can be found using Google or other search engines.
- Linkable: Messages have a permalink on the web.
- Open: Messages are in the open.
- Public: Messages are public.
- Indexed: Messages are indexed by search engines.

This phrasing, especially with regard to messages being searchable and linkable, is inspired by the [discussion][] criteria of [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices][] program.

Examples of communication tools that support the SLOPI style include:

- mailing lists with public archives
- public forums
- public issue trackers
- Gitter
- IRC channels with public logs
- XMPP rooms with public logs
- public roadmaps
- public kanban boards

(As part of [issue #2][] we are gathering examples in the wild in a [spreadsheet][].)

While open source projects should endeavor to communicate in the SLOPI style whenever possible (as discussed in [issue #12][]), this style is inappropriate for security, code of conduct violations, and telling co-workers on your floor that you brought in donuts.

The SLOPI style can take some getting used to if you are new to open source culture. It's ok to be a little sloppy. Please don't worry if the message you send isn't perfect. The fact that you sent it in the open is appreciated. Open source is getting friendlier. A thick skin isn't as necessary as it was in the past.

## Open source organizations that favor a SLOPI communication style

### The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) requires open communications

[The Apache Way][] indicates an embrace of open communications, saying (emphasis added):

> "**Open Communications**: as a virtual organization, **the ASF requires all communications related to code and decision-making to be publicly accessible** to ensure asynchronous collaboration, as necessitated by a globally-distributed community. Project mailing lists are archived, publicly accessible, and include:
> 
> - dev@ (primary project development);
> - user@ (user community discussion and peer support);
> - commits@ (automated source change notifications); and
> - occasionally supporting roles such as marketing@ (project visibility),
> 
> ...as well as restricted, day-to-day operational lists for Project Management Committees. **Private decisions on code, policies, or project direction are disallowed; off-list discourse and transactions must be brought on-list.** More on [communications][] and the [use of mailing lists][]."

### Debian will not hide problems

Commitment 3 from the [Debian Social Contract][] is "**We will not hide problems**" and is expressed in this way (emphasis added):

> "We will keep our entire bug report database **open for public view at all times**. Reports that people file online will promptly become visible to others."

## Companies involved in open source that favor a SLOPI communication style

### Gitlab has most company communications public on the Internet

The [Single Source of Truth][] section of the "GitLab Values" chapter of their team handbook states (emphasis added):

> **By having most company communications and work artifacts be internet-public, we have one single source of truth for all GitLab team members, users, customers, and other community members.** We don't need separate artifacts with different permissions for different people.

[Single Source of Truth]: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth

### Mozilla has an FAQ and resources for when, why and how to work open

Mozilla's [Working open][] FAQ came out of a 2013 [Practicing Open][] talk and has the following to say under **Open vs. Transparent** about moving from "passively transparent" to "open" (emphasis added):

> - **transparent**: Public, but not necessarily enabling participation.
> - **passively transparent**: Not private; decisions aren’t actively hidden, but are difficult to locate. They may not even be documented. This is usually not done intentionally.
> - **actively transparent**: **Everything is written down, is easily searchable and is locatable by interested parties.** This requires intentional, sustained effort.
> - **open**: **Public and participatory. This requires structuring efforts so that "outsiders" can meaningfully participate (and become "insiders" as appropriate).**
